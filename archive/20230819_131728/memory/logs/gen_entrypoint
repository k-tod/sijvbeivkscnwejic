The project should be fully functional and follow best practices for Python programming and file structure. \n\nAssumptions:\n1. The project will be a simple command-line application.\n2. The application will perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).\n3. The application will be structured in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style.\n4. The application will use Python 3.\n\nCore Classes, Functions, and Methods:\n1. `Calculator`: This is the main class that will contain methods for each arithmetic operation.\n2. `add`: This method will add two numbers.\n3. `subtract`: This method will subtract one number from another.\n4. `multiply`: This method will multiply two numbers.\n5. `divide`: This method will divide one number by another.\n6. `main`: This is the entry point function that will handle user input and output.\n\nNow, let's create the files and their content.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom calculator import Calculator\n\ndef main():\n    calculator = Calculator()\n    while True:\n        print(\"\\n1.

The `Calculator` class is defined in `calculator.py` and contains methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `main` function in `main.py` is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and uses it to perform operations based on user input. The application continues to run and ask for user input until the user chooses to exit.
