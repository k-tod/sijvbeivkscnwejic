Based on the instructions, it seems like we are to create a Python project with multiple files, each containing classes, functions, and methods. The project should be fully functional and follow best practices for Python programming and file structure. 

Assumptions:
1. The project will be a simple command-line application.
2. The application will perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
3. The application will be structured in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style.
4. The application will use Python 3.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Calculator`: This is the main class that will contain methods for each arithmetic operation.
2. `add`: This method will add two numbers.
3. `subtract`: This method will subtract one number from another.
4. `multiply`: This method will multiply two numbers.
5. `divide`: This method will divide one number by another.
6. `main`: This is the entry point function that will handle user input and output.

Now, let's create the files and their content.

main.py
