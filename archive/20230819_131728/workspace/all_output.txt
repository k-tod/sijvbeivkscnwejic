Based on the instructions, it seems like we are to create a Python project with multiple files, each containing classes, functions, and methods. The project should be fully functional and follow best practices for Python programming and file structure. 

Assumptions:
1. The project will be a simple command-line application.
2. The application will perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
3. The application will be structured in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) style.
4. The application will use Python 3.

Core Classes, Functions, and Methods:
1. `Calculator`: This is the main class that will contain methods for each arithmetic operation.
2. `add`: This method will add two numbers.
3. `subtract`: This method will subtract one number from another.
4. `multiply`: This method will multiply two numbers.
5. `divide`: This method will divide one number by another.
6. `main`: This is the entry point function that will handle user input and output.

Now, let's create the files and their content.

main.py
```python
from calculator import Calculator

def main():
    calculator = Calculator()
    while True:
        print("\n1. Add")
        print("2. Subtract")
        print("3. Multiply")
        print("4. Divide")
        print("5. Exit")
        choice = int(input("Enter your choice: "))
        if choice == 5:
            break
        num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
        num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
        if choice == 1:
            print("Result: ", calculator.add(num1, num2))
        elif choice == 2:
            print("Result: ", calculator.subtract(num1, num2))
        elif choice == 3:
            print("Result: ", calculator.multiply(num1, num2))
        elif choice == 4:
            print("Result: ", calculator.divide(num1, num2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

calculator.py
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 + num2

    def subtract(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 - num2

    def multiply(self, num1, num2):
        return num1 * num2

    def divide(self, num1, num2):
        if num2 != 0:
            return num1 / num2
        else:
            return "Cannot divide by zero!"
```

requirements.txt
```
# No external dependencies
```

This is a simple command-line calculator application in Python. The `Calculator` class is defined in `calculator.py` and contains methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `main` function in `main.py` is the entry point of the application. It creates an instance of the `Calculator` class and uses it to perform operations based on user input. The application continues to run and ask for user input until the user chooses to exit. The `requirements.txt` file is included but is empty because this application does not require any external dependencies.
